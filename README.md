# wormhole-gui (German Version)

This is the first attempt to create a german version of Wormhole-Gui inclusive german PGP-wordlist. Due to the fact that Fyne has no native language-support, i'm forced to translate Fyne directly inline in code. I hope that this will not be a challenge for future code-releases. I will do my very best ...

# wormhole-gui

Wormhole-gui is a cross-platform application that lets you easily share files, folders and text between devices.
It uses the Go implementation of magic-wormhole, called [wormhole-william](https://github.com/vitusb/wormhole-william), and compiles statically into a single binary. Wormhole-gui is also compatible with sending to and receiving from other wormhole clients, such as the cli applications from both [wormhole-william](https://github.com/vitusb/wormhole-william) and [magic-wormhole](https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole).

- [compress](https://github.com/klauspost/compress) (version 1.14.4)
